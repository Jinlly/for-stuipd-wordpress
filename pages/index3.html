                <h2>Inadequate equipment and technology</h2>
                <p>
                    In fact, to this day, VR equipment is still insufficient for entertainment and video game purposes.
                    Players' pursuit of complex actions and immersive desires make miniaturized, home-type VR devices
                    completely unable to meet the needs of entertainment, and large-scale devices cannot be
                    mass-produced into consumers' homes. This makes it difficult for many companies specializing in the
                    development of VR excellence, and the types and gameplay of games are also very limited. In such an
                    environment, the market has quickly ushered in saturation, and very few VR games account for the
                    vast majority of sales in their genre.

                <h2>Not realistic enough</h2>
                <p>
                    At the same time, unlike learning and training, VR technology is completely unreal at the
                    entertainment level. The limitations of image technology and extremely complex calculations make the
                    current VR game graphics even lag behind the mainstream graphics 15 years ago. With current
                    technology, this is a completely insurmountable hurdle. At the same time, in order to prevent
                    epilepsy and panic, maybe VR games are destined to not be very realistic, which is contrary to its
                    main purpose.

                <h2>Expensive equipment</h2>
                <p>
                    Simply put, most people are reluctant to spend too much money on entertainment, and home VR is now
                    extremely expensive, almost on par with luxury goods. This turns entertainment that should belong to
                    the many into the privilege of the few. The sluggish consumption power has rejected more
                    corresponding development attempts.

            <p>
                Many studies have pointed out that overly realistic violent games are very immoral. On the one hand,
                developers continue to launch realistic and more extreme experiences in order to stimulate the market,
                and consumers are exposed to such an environment for a long time.
