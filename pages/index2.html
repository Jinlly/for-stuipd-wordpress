                <h2>The over optimistic estimate</h2>
                <p>
                    Many studies like J Adv Med Educ Prof (2018) and Polina Häfner (2013) point out that the
                    application of VR teaching tools has greatly improved the effect of medical and engineering
                    equipment operation training. At the same time, compared to using real equipment to operate, VR
                    tools also greatly reduce the risk and equipment loss, which makes the application prospects of VR
                    in training look very optimistic. In fact, this is also the most extensive application scenario of
                    current VR technology. However, the development of VR technology for different training scenarios is
                    very slow. This may be because the professionals who apply these tools need extremely high
                    professionalism, and the developers of VR technology need to learn for a long time to develop the
                    corresponding VR environment, and these However, the replacement speed of the field is extremely
                    fast, and the technology that has just been developed is often faced with the problem of being
                    eliminated.

                <h2>The high costs</h2>
                <p>
                    The problem of high cost and development appears in almost every field of VR. Unlike traditional
                    products, the development of VR products has the characteristics of long cycle, high requirements
                    and uncertain returns. This has discouraged many emerging companies, and the VR systems developed by
                    established companies are too expensive.

                <h2>Overlap between real and reality</h2>
                <p>
                    Falah(2014) points out that although the training in the VR environment is very effective, the
                    cost of trial and error for students in the VR environment is too low, which makes it possible for
                    imperfect technicians to make irreversible mistakes in the face of completely different situations
                    in reality. Mistakes, which are especially deadly in anatomical and clinical medicine where extreme
                    precision is required, and the blurring of the boundaries between virtual reality and reality have a
                    negative impact on this issue.

                At the same time, it was also pointed out that the training based on VR environment is often less
                efficient than actual operation, resulting in the training time being greatly prolonged with different
                tools.
