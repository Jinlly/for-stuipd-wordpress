                <h2>Validity</h2>
                <p>
                    Although as early as 2004 Joan McComas points out in his research that VR education can be
                    effective in some scenarios. The application of VR in teaching has always been controversial. One of
                    the reasons may be that modern education has evolved over a long period of time, and the newly born
                    VR technology is not mature in the research of different types of teaching(StéphaniePhilippe,2020).
                    This has led to a lack
                    of relevant theoretical basis and research on the promotion of courses based on VR as a basic tool,
                    and more schools have adopted traditional teaching methods, because at least they are proven
                    effective.

                <h2>Limited applied disciplines and high costs</h2>
                <p>
                    It must be noted that not all disciplines have comparative use of VR as a teaching tool. For
                    example, in basic mathematics and language subjects, paper-based classrooms are effective enough,
                    and it is wasteful to introduce VR as a teaching tool. At the same time, while VR equipment imposes
                    higher equipment requirements on schools, it also increases learning consumption in disguise, which
                    may lead to an overall increase in tuition fees, which further threatens the fairness of education
                    while increasing the cost of learning.

                <h2>VR school paradox</h2>
                <p>
                    Fransson point out in her article "The challenges of using head mounted virtual reality in K-12
                    schools from a teacher perspective" that the smaller the school, the easier it is for emerging
                    schools to transition to VR teaching, while those with well-established teaching systems are more
                    likely to transition to VR. On the contrary, it is difficult for large schools to get close to VR
                    technology. At the same time, the quality of teaching in small schools is very unreliable. Even from
                    the data point of view, in the 10 years from 2010 to 2020, a large number of small VR teaching
                    institutions appeared and disappeared, while those really excellent schools were very Difficult to
                    complete the transformation

                I linked the WordPress to my page wthere I have full control of my elements and content.
                If You can see other links at home page that gose to who knows where, Please do not click, I used code
                editor to see the WordPress code, they are just not there, NOT in my editor.
